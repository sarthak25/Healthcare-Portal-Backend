# Healthcare-Portal-Backend

The aim of this project is to create a patient-doctor portal so that we can improve the diagnostic process by reducing the patient’s commute time, reduce the payment required for treatment and help in creating a self-diagnostic system to make use of the doctor’s time more efficiently.

This is the backend of the healthcare portal project.

This includes Application Programming Interface construction
for the python codes for face recognition and recommendation
systems, which could then be accessed and called through HTTP
requests through the backend server.
